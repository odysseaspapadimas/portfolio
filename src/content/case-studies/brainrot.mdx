## TL;DR (Snapshot)

- **What it is:** SaaS that turns raw clips into short, captioned videos with high-contrast “brainrot” subtitles and smart layouts for TikTok/Reels/Shorts.
- **Who it’s for:** Creators, marketers, and solo founders who need thumb-stopping clips _fast_.
- **Proof:** **2.2k+ users**, **#11 Product of the Day** on Product Hunt.
- **Surface area:** onboarding, editor, rendering pipeline, exports, billing, admin tooling, analytics, email.
- **My role:** End-to-end design & engineering (product, backend, frontend, ops, release).

---

## Highlights

- **Acquisition:** PH launch, SEO-ready landing, Google & TikTok OAuth via NextAuth, automated welcome credits + email.
- **Activation:** Multi-step studio with live Remotion preview, credit estimator, template library; first export designed to ship in **\<5 minutes** end-to-end (ElevenLabs + Remotion Lambda).
- **Retention:** Saved projects in a searchable library, rename/download/share flows, S3 migration helper, default subtitle presets, lifecycle emails through Resend.
- **Revenue:** Stripe Checkout credit packs (1000 credits ≈ 1 min of narration), coupon support, webhook-driven ledger in Postgres, Discord alerts for every purchase.
- **Operations:** Vercel CI/CD, PostHog product analytics, Sentry errors + session replay, Discord ops hooks, self-serve admin email campaigns.

> **Positioning:** Not just a demo—**a complete product** with auth, billing, storage, admin, analytics, and support loops.

## Product Surface

### Acquisition

- Product Hunt launch with teaser video, founder-led comments, and early testimonials.
- Landing page built as a Next.js App Router view with async data (demo video pulled from S3) and copy tuned for “before/after” storytelling.
- Signup is one click with Google or TikTok providers; welcome flow awards starter credits and sends a Resend welcome email + Discord notification.

### Activation

- Five-step studio (video source → voice → script → subtitles → review) backed by React Hook Form + Zod; local storage resume if the tab closes.
- Template gallery pulls from S3 so a new user can export without uploading.
- Subtitle step renders a live Remotion player with timing inferred from the script; highlight color updates debounce to keep the preview smooth.
- Credit estimator (1000 credits/min) checks balance server-side before calling ElevenLabs + Remotion, then polls Lambda every 3s with optimistic progress UI.

### Retention

- Library table (TanStack Table + Framer Motion) shows status, estimated/actual credits, rename, preview, download, and delete actions per video.
- Resend + React Email templates for welcome, feature updates, and nudges; admin UI can send staged campaigns or production blasts.
- Middleware (`/library`, `/account`, `/admin`) ensures authenticated access, while admin routes stay behind an allow-list.

### Revenue

- Stripe Checkout in payment mode sells credit packs; product metadata drives how many credits are minted on webhook success.
- Webhooks reconcile payments, persist invoices, and update user balances in Drizzle.
- Discord notification firehose for new purchases keeps ops aware in real time.
- Pricing page fetches live Stripe product data; “Purchase” CTA reroutes to Checkout or login depending on auth state.

## Architecture (Overview)

> **Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router, RSC) • TypeScript • Zod • Drizzle ORM on Neon Postgres • AWS S3 + Remotion Lambda • ElevenLabs TTS • Stripe Checkout/Webhooks • Resend • PostHog • Sentry • Discord webhooks.

- **App**

  - Server Actions orchestrated with React Server Components for fast reads.
  - Protected routing for studio, library, account, and admin areas.
  - Client UX built with Radix primitives, Tailwind, Framer Motion animations, and Remotion Player embeds.

- **Data**

  - Neon Postgres holds users, videos (status/credits/errors), payments, invoices, support requests.
  - Drizzle migrations versioned alongside schema; Neon HTTP adapter keeps cold starts low.

- **Media & Processing**

  - Client uploads use presigned cloud URLs; templates live in a dedicated cloud area.
  - ElevenLabs API returns audio + per-word timing to build captions.
  - Remotion Lambda renders video compositions with webhook callbacks; status polling + webhook both update video state.
  - Outputs stored back in cloud storage, signed at view/download time.

- **Billing**

  - Stripe Checkout session uses payment mode with promotion codes, attaches or creates customers, and records every payment + invoice row.
  - Credit debits happen inside the render webhook to guarantee idempotent charging once the render succeeds.

- **Observability & Ops**
  - Sentry (browser + server) with Replay for repros; user tied to session in the auth event.
  - PostHog client in production-only provider; Vercel Speed Insights for performance.
  - Real-time notifications for signup/purchase; admin email console for campaigns.

---

## Security & Privacy

- OAuth (Google, TikTok) via NextAuth with httpOnly session cookies; protected routes enforced via middleware.
- Admin console restricted to a short allow-list; server actions double-check ownership.
- Render webhooks validated with HMAC signatures; Stripe signatures verified via official SDK.
- All media access goes through presigned cloud URLs; uploads scoped per user.
- Secrets stay in env vars; database stores minimal PII (name, email, credits).

---

## Launch & Growth

- Product Hunt launch (#11 Product of the Day) pulled in the first wave of creators.
- Organic discovery through short-form demos, targeted X/Twitter clips, and community shoutouts.
- Automated lifecycle emails (“first export ready”, “credits running low”) nurture retention; Discord keeps the team looped on every signup/purchase.
